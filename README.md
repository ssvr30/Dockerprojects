# Dockerprojects
This repo contains list of projects recreated with Docker toolchain. 

These are such implementations which were built in traditional compute environment like enterprises and self-managed infrastructure.

The built appllcation can be predominatly classified as monoliths using virtual machines or physical servers. 

The intent is to visualize such implementations seamlessly with Docker and its toolchain for a resilent, scalable and simple design.

The scope of this project work is completely created on a Desktop running Ubuntu. 

Hope this gives you a direction to start on your own or contribute your ideas with towards the community to help build a quick, portable, purpose built and scalable infrastructures which can support modern applications. In parallel help monolith applications to modularize and imbibe microservice framework gradually.
